			<p>White Flag Congress is a coalition of limited government organizations dedicated to exposing the culture of surrender in Washington, D.C.  We exist to call out capitulating lawmakers <em>by name</em> when they betray your interests by caving to more government overreach and overspending.  Our goal is to rally opposition to these sellouts - forging a Congress that will stand <em>against</em> oppression instead of perpetually accommodating it.</p>
 			<p>History has shown us that appeasing tyrants only empowers them to undertake more egregious usurpations.  They can sense equivocation - and they feed off of weakness.  If our "leaders" keep giving in - then they will keep taking as much as they can: Life, liberty, property and prosperity.</p>
			<p>White Flag Congress is led by <strong>Ed Martin</strong>, president of Eagle Forum and the successor of <strong>Phyllis Schlafley</strong< - one of the founders of the modern conservative movement.  A former state party chairman and chief of staff to the governor of Missouri, Ed has an extensive, distinguished record of fighting for liberty at the state and national levels.</p>
