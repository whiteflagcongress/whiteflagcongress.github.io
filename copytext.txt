#NOSURRENDER
 
America is drowning … in debt, dependency, despair and dysfunction.  And if we don’t fix it now – our Republic is likely lost.  Yet at this pivotal moment – when our representatives in Washington, D.C. should be standing stronger and fighting harder than ever for us – they’re caving more and more to them.  On taxes, spending, immigration and trade – the special interests run this country, not the people.  And they’re moving bought-and-paid for politicians of both parties further to the left with each passing day.

Where do we turn?  Who will stop the sellouts?  How can we get our lawmakers to start doing what's right for "We the People," not the Washington insiders? 

The answer is easy: We have to "be the change."  We can't rely on "Republicans" or "conservatives" any longer to stand up for us: We have to stand up for ourselves.
